In order to build the app we will be using Tkinter because Python Tkinter is the standard Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is supported in Python. When Tkinter is used alongside Python, it results in the creation of GUI very conveniently and quite fast. The main advantage of using Tkinter is that it has an object-oriented interface. The success of any application or website depends on how well it interacts with the user, i.e. an attractive graphical interface helps to create a good application. Well, Python Tkinter does that for us.
